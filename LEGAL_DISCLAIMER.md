## 2. Core Disclaimers

### 2.1 Primary Disclaimer (Displayed Prominently in App)

```
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This app provides indicative estimates only, not medical advice.

Our calculations are based on the LactMed nomogram (NIH/NLM) with a 10%
conservative safety margin. However, alcohol metabolism varies significantly
between individuals due to genetics, health status, medications, and other factors.

This tool is designed to help you make informed decisions, but cannot account
for your unique circumstances. Always:
- Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice
- Consider your individual situation (health, medications, fatigue)
- Err on the side of caution if uncertain
- Never rely solely on this app for important decisions

Your use of this app is at your own risk. We make no guarantees about the
accuracy or suitability of these estimates for your specific situation.

By using this app, you acknowledge that you understand and accept these limitations.
```

### 2.2 In-App Disclaimer Locations

**Required placement:**
1. ✅ Onboarding screen (user must acknowledge)
2. ✅ Countdown display ("Indicatie, geen medisch advies")
3. ✅ Planning results screen
4. ✅ Settings/About section
5. ✅ Terms & Conditions (detailed)

### 2.3 Calculation Methodology Disclosure

```
METHODOLOGY TRANSPARENCY

Calculation Basis:
- LactMed nomogram (NIH/NLM) - peer-reviewed, evidence-based
- Zero-order clearance kinetics (conservative approach)
- Weight-based interpolation (54kg, 68kg, 82kg reference points)
- 10% safety buffer for individual variation

This methodology is based on population averages from scientific studies.
Individual results may vary by ±15-25% due to factors including:
- Genetic metabolism differences
- Liver function
- Medications
- Illness or fatigue
- Ethnic background
- Hydration status

See SAFETY_BUFFER_RATIONALE.md for full scientific documentation.

## 8. Comparison to Harm Without Tool

### 8.1 Risk-Benefit Analysis

**Without this app:**
- ❌ Mothers estimate clearance times with no data
- ❌ May use overly conservative rules (e.g., "pump and dump") unnecessarily
- ❌ May use overly risky rules (e.g., "when I feel sober")
- ❌ Less education about alcohol metabolism
- ❌ No consistency in approach

**With this app:**
- ✅ Evidence-based estimates with safety margins
- ✅ Consistent methodology
- ✅ Educational component
- ✅ Promotes informed decision-making
- ✅ Encourages conservative choices through transparency

### 8.2 Public Health Perspective

**Our position:**
> "Providing evidence-based information with clear limitations is preferable to
> leaving individuals to guess. Our tool reduces harm by promoting informed
> choices, not by eliminating risk entirely."

**Comparable precedents:**
- BMI calculators (population averages, individual variation)
- Ovulation trackers (estimates, not guarantees)
- Sleep trackers (suggestions, not medical advice)
- Nutrition apps (guidelines, not prescriptions)

All widely accepted despite individual variation and disclaimer requirements.
