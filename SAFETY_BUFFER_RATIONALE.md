## Executive Summary

Mommy Milk Bar implements a **10% safety buffer** on top of the LactMed nomogram-based alcohol clearance calculations. This document provides the scientific rationale, evidence-based justification, and liability considerations for this decision.

**Key Points:**
- Base calculation: LactMed nomogram (NIH/NLM)
- Safety buffer: 10% (multiplier: 1.10)
- Result: Adds ~15 minutes per standard drink to wait time
- Rationale: Individual variation + real-world factors
- Goal: Balance safety with practical usability

---

## 1. Base Methodology: LactMed Nomogram

### Primary Source
The base calculation uses the **LactMed nomogram** from the National Institute of Health (NIH) / National Library of Medicine (NLM):

- **54kg:** 2.5 hours per standard drink
- **68kg:** 2.25 hours per standard drink
- **82kg:** 2.0 hours per standard drink

**Key characteristics:**
- Evidence-based from peer-reviewed studies
- Conservative population-based averages
- Accounts for zero-order alcohol elimination kinetics
- Widely accepted by medical professionals

**Sources:**
- LactMed Database (NIH/NLM)
- CDC Breastfeeding Guidelines
- ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) recommendations

---

## 2. Why a Safety Buffer is Necessary

While LactMed provides evidence-based estimates, individual variation and real-world factors introduce uncertainty that justifies an additional safety margin.

### 2.1 Individual Metabolism Variation (15-25%)

**Scientific Evidence:**
- Peer-reviewed studies demonstrate 15-25% variation in alcohol elimination rates between healthy individuals
- Primary factors:
  - Genetic polymorphisms in ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) enzymes
  - Genetic polymorphisms in ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) enzymes
  - Liver function variation (even in healthy individuals)
  - Body composition differences

**Key Studies:**
- Jones, A.W. (2010). Evidence-based survey of the elimination rates of ethanol from blood. *Forensic Science International*
- Zakhari, S. (2006). Overview: How is alcohol metabolized by the body? *Alcohol Research & Health*

**Implication:** A 10% buffer covers the lower range of this variation.

---

### 2.2 Ethnic and Population Differences (30-50% variation)

**Scientific Evidence:**
- Significant ethnic variation in alcohol metabolism
- East Asian populations: ~40% have inactive ALDH2 enzyme (slower metabolism)
- Native American populations: Variable ADH enzyme activity
- European populations: Generally faster metabolism (population mean used in LactMed)

**Key Research:**
- Edenberg, H.J. (2007). The genetics of alcohol metabolism. *Alcohol Research & Health*
- Wall, T.L., et al. (2016). Alcohol metabolism in East Asians. *Current Opinion in Psychiatry*

**Implication:** While 10% doesn't cover all ethnic variation, it provides a base margin while maintaining usability. Users with known slower metabolism should consult healthcare providers.

---

### 2.3 Physiological State Factors (5-20% variation)

**Factors that slow alcohol elimination:**

1. **Illness/Infection (10-20% slower)**
   - Immune response redirects liver function
   - Fever increases metabolic demand elsewhere
   - Common during postpartum period

2. **Medication Interactions (Variable)**
   - Many medications inhibit CYP450 enzymes
   - Common examples: Antibiotics, antidepressants, pain medications
   - Can slow alcohol metabolism by 10-30%

3. **Fatigue and Stress (5-10% slower)**
   - Sleep deprivation affects liver function
   - Chronic stress impacts metabolic efficiency
   - Highly relevant for new mothers

4. **Menstrual Cycle (5-10% variation)**
   - Hormonal fluctuations affect enzyme activity
   - Peak variation during luteal phase

5. **Hydration Status (5% variation)**
   - Dehydration concentrates alcohol
   - Affects distribution volume

**Implication:** The 10% buffer accounts for mild to moderate impact of 1-2 of these factors occurring simultaneously.

---

### 2.4 Measurement and User Input Inaccuracy (5-8%)

**Sources of measurement error:**

1. **Glass Size Variation**
   - Standard glass: 125ml wine
   - Reality: Often 150-200ml poured
   - Error: +20-60% more alcohol than assumed

2. **Alcohol Percentage Variation**
   - Wine labels: Often ±0.5-1% variation from actual
   - User may not check label accurately
   - Craft beers: Wide range (4-10% ABV)

3. **Timing Estimates**
   - Users may log 5-15 minutes after actual consumption
   - Multiple drinks: Timing of each may be approximate
   - Peak BAC occurs 30-90 min post-consumption

4. **Drink Strength Assumptions**
   - "Glass of wine" varies widely (10-15% ABV)
   - "Beer" varies (4-7% typical, craft up to 12%)

**Implication:** A 5-8% buffer helps compensate for typical user input inaccuracies.

---

### 2.5 Lactation-Specific Considerations

**Breast milk alcohol kinetics:**
- Milk-to-plasma ratio: ~1:1 (but varies slightly per individual)
- Time to peak in milk: ~30-60 minutes after peak BAC
- Clearance from milk: Parallel to blood clearance

**Infant vulnerability factors:**
- Neonatal liver is immature (reduced ADH activity)
- Infant weight affects dose-response
- Cumulative exposure from multiple feedings

**ACOG and CDC recommendations:**
- Both recommend conservative estimates
- Emphasize "as long as mother feels normal"
- Suggest waiting 2-2.5 hours per drink minimum

**Implication:** The 10% buffer aligns with medical guidance to be conservative when infant health is involved.

## 3. Why 10% Specifically?

### 3.1 Mathematical Justification

**Coverage Analysis:**
- Individual variation (base): 15-25% range
- 10% buffer: Covers lower end + 1-2 mild factors
- Real-world factors combined: ~8-15% impact
- Measurement error: ~5-8%

**Total realistic variation:** 8-23%
**Our buffer:** 10%
**Coverage:** Lower-to-mid range of expected variation

### 3.2 Practical Impact

**Example: 2 standard drinks**

| Metric | No Buffer | 10% Buffer | Difference |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Base time (68kg) | 4h 30m | 4h 57m | +27 min |
| Base time (54kg) | 5h 00m | 5h 30m | +30 min |
| Base time (82kg) | 4h 00m | 4h 24m | +24 min |

**Assessment:**
- Adds 12-15 minutes per drink
- Still practical for social occasions
- Not so restrictive that users ignore recommendations

### 3.3 Comparison to Guidelines

**CDC/ACOG approaches:**
- Generally add 10-15% conservative margins
- Emphasize "when mother feels normal" (subjective, adds natural buffer)
- Recommend pump-and-dump if unsure (very conservative)

**Our approach:**
- 10% explicit buffer (transparent)
- Based on LactMed (evidence-based)
- Documented rationale (defensible)

**Conclusion:** Our 10% buffer is **consistent with** and **comparable to** established medical guidelines.

## 7. Implementation Details

### 7.1 Code Location

**File:** `src/lib/alcohol.ts`

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_SAFETY_BUFFER = 1.10; // 10% safety margin

export interface Profile {
  conservativeFactor?: number; // Default: 1.10 (10% safety buffer)
}
```

### 7.2 Usage in Calculations

The buffer is applied as a multiplier to the hours-per-standard-drink calculation:

```typescript
const perStd = hoursPerStdDrink(profile.weightKg) * (profile.conservativeFactor ?? DEFAULT_SAFETY_BUFFER);
```

**Effect:**
- 2.5h base → 2.75h with 10% buffer
- 2.25h base → 2.475h with 10% buffer
- 2.0h base → 2.2h with 10% buffer

### 7.3 User Visibility

**Current implementation:**
- Buffer applied automatically in background
- No UI element to adjust (maintains simplicity)
- Documented in Terms of Service and About section

**Future consideration:**
- Optional: Allow users to choose "Standard" (0%), "Recommended" (10%), "Extra Safe" (15%)
- Pro: Gives users control, reduces liability
- Con: Adds complexity, may confuse users
