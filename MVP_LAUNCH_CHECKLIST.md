## 🟡 STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (Before Public Launch)

### Technical - Reliability

**TASK 10: Add Loading States to Async Operations**
- **Issue:** No feedback during delete account, export data, etc.
- **Files:**
  - [ ] [app/(tabs)/profile.tsx](app/(tabs)/profile.tsx:236) - Export data
  - [ ] [app/(tabs)/profile.tsx](app/(tabs)/profile.tsx) - Delete account
  - [ ] Profile edit modals
- **Implementation:** Add `isLoading` state, show ActivityIndicator
- **Estimate:** 1-2 hours

**TASK 11: Add Input Validation**
- **Issue:** No validation on custom drink inputs or profile data
- **Files:**
  - [ ] [app/(tabs)/drinks.tsx](app/(tabs)/drinks.tsx:161) - Custom alcohol %
  - [ ] [app/(tabs)/drinks.tsx](app/(tabs)/drinks.tsx:170-182) - Quantity limits (max 10)
  - [ ] Profile modals - Weight/height ranges
- **Implementation:** Add validation functions with user-friendly errors
- **Estimate:** 1-2 hours

**TASK 12: Fix Email Verification Flow**
- **Issue:** App calls RPC but should call Edge Function

- **Implementation:**
  ```typescript
  const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('verify-email', {

- **Estimate:** 15 minutes

### Database - Maintenance

- **Estimate:** 5 minutes

**TASK 14: Schedule Analytics Anonymization**
- **Issue:** GDPR requires data retention limits
- **Implementation:**

  - [ ] Schedule: `SELECT cron.schedule('anonymize-analytics', '0 2 * * *', 'SELECT anonymize_old_analytics()');`
- **Estimate:** 10 minutes

### Content - Trust & Credibility
